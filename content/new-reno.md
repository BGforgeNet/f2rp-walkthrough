# New Reno

The 'Barking man' is a new character that you can help. If you find and talk to him (located in the very back of the building that is northwest of Jules, see picture), you can determine that he has a case of epilepsy if you have 75 science. See the [EPA](/epa/#indigo-level) section on how to help him.

'Three-Card Monte' is also a new character that can be found near the big sign between Virgin street and Second street. You can gamble with him (but he cheats). He can also give you information about the Richard Wright OD, Pretty Boy Lloyd, Your missing car, Eldridge, and the location of Golgotha. He will sell you information, 100-200$ for info on Eldridge and $250-$1000 for quest related stuff (harder speech check the lower you offer him). There is another way though. He cheats at cards so why not cheat him back? Steal his deck of cards and replace it with a marked deck, or simply buy his deck and sell him your marked one (100 XP). Marked cards can be found on a shelf upstairs at the Desperado or dug up from one of the northern graves at Golgotha. After you've won 11 times (and are $200 richer), he won't be able to pay you his debt, so you can get information for free (only once).

To ask him for quest info, you have to have the quests active. Also, you can only get the info for free at the time you have beaten him, you can't come back later and ask for it.

If you buy info from Monte, that money gets added to his gambling pot. So you can just buy all the info and then win your money back.

{{< note >}}Once you have cleaned him out, he will not gamble with you anymore, even if you buy info from him.{{< /note >}}

'Nikki' is another new character that can be found in Salvatore's casino in the back room. She knows where Pretty Boy Lloyd is hiding. You can bribe her into telling you for $500. This is what he owes her for her part in the scam. You get 250 XP. If you threaten her, she only tells you she's heard he's staying at the Desperado, but won't say he's in the boiler room and you get no XP. There is a speech check, but I don't think it's very high.

At the Shark Club (Bishop's casino), female characters can now dance, and male characters can now be a comedian, and get paid for it:
- $300 every time and 150 XP the first time for Male comedian. (CH 8, or speech 76, or have the smooth talker perk to tell a good joke. A bad joke gives no reward.)
- $250-350 (it seems to vary) every week and 150 XP the first time as a female dancer. (CH 7, AG 7, or being a porn star.)

Black leather and/or the ball gag are items that have a slight effect on dancing. If you're feeling adventurous, try it out.

Old Man McGee is the guy standing in front of a slot machine in the Shark Club. If you play his machine and hit the jack pot, he will get angry and demand that you give him the winnings, or he'll attack. If you don't have CH 9, the Good natured trait, or speech over 35, you won't get the chance to talk your way out of the situation. Your only option will be to fight. You can give him the money for +10 karma, or convince him to accept half of the money for +5 karma, and he will be happy. If you choose to talk about it, you'll have to pass two fairly easy speech checks before having to pay him some money back, but better to skip those and offer him the money right away. He will always accept $500 (or $250 if you pass a barter check). If you fail any of his skill checks he will attack.

{{< note >}}You have to first offer the money you won, before you can choose what amount to give back.{{< /note >}}

Doing some repairing and cleaning on McGee's slot machine gives you 50 XP, or if you get a critical_success you get 100 XP. It can only be done once, so if you fail you get nothing. You can still do the repair on it after you've won, even though it supposedly is broken beyond repair by then.

During the desert transaction between the Salvatores and the Enclave, it is now possible to sneak aboard the Vertibird. It will take you to Navarro. See the [Navarro](/navarro/) section for more details.

Going on a date with Miss Kitty now gives +1 AG if you successfully asked her out before the end of the game. The date will not happen until you come back from the Oil rig though. So it won't matter much except for the satisfaction of getting a reward, unless you feel using the fallout 2 hintbook is a bit too much, then it can be quite handy.

Eldridge the gun merchant will now go back and check on his dogs if they bark too much (as was originally planned). So pay attention when he starts moving and don't hang around if you don't want to get caught. Also his front door is now locked at night time.

## An extended way of getting to the Stables as a woman

Talk to Jules and pay him $75 to tell you about the Mordinos. Ask him all you can about Jet, ("factory?" and "maker?" questions) to find out about Myron, and that he receives prostitutes. Talk to Jagged Jimmy J next. Ask him where he gets his Jet, and more about Myron. You should then have an option to ask him about meeting Myron. Choose the one with "How do I meet this Living-God..?" Now you can ask Miss Kitty and volunteer to be the next girl sent to the Stables. You get 500 XP for this, but I think you would get the same for finding the Stables anyway. Females can also get the experience for this even after getting experience for finding the Stables another way.
