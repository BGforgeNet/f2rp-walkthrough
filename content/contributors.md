~~If it wasn't credited as written by someone else, then Morticia wrote it, or quoted it, or mis-quoted it, and didn't give proper credit.~~

If you have additions or corrections, please open an issue in [walkthrough repository](https://github.com/BGforgeNet/f2rp-walkthrough).

As Morticia, the rightful owner of this homepage has gone AWOL and her address is no longer valid I, Darek, have decided to revive this page. Hopefully she will be back soon to reclaim it. Anyway, I have updated this guide to reflect the RP 2.3 version.

Notes: If you are missing the pictures that were previously in the guide, know that they were mostly obsolete and I couldn't be arsed to make new ones. I also removed the "info from Darek" and "by Darek" as it was just getting annoying. I've probably written about half this guide if anyone is interested.

Update: Darek's page also went down, now it's hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/BGforgeNet/f2rp-walkthrough).
