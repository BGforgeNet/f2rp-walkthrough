# Klamath

The interior door of Vic's shack is locked and trapped. To find and disarm the trap, there's a traps skill roll. This is (probably) equal to your current traps skill level, so with skill 20 you would have a 20% chance of success. To open the door, the chance is your skill level -30%. Therefore, you need over 30 in lockpicking to even have a small chance of opening it. You can obviously try as many times as you want, until you get a critical failure and jam the lock. Stealing a molotov cocktail from Aldo, the drunken town greeter, and throwing it at the door is a viable alternative if all else fails.

## 1. Figure out who is rustling the Brahmin

Talk to Maida Buckner and ask about what's going on in town. She'll mention that someone is rustling Brahmin. Next, accept Torr's job to help him guard the Brahmin or do the shady work for the Dunton brothers. It doesn't matter which one as the important part is to check the shack and collect the Radscorpion limbs as evidence from the grazing area.

When you have the scorpion limbs you can go and report to Ardin Buckner, but she'll just tell you she needs more evidence. To find more you can go over to examine (binocular icon) the Brahmins behind the Dunton's place. There is a perception roll check here and if you don't make it you can keep trying until you do. Anyway, you will notice they have different markings that someone has branded over. With the 2 clues, you can now prove the Duntons were rustling and collect a reward (300 XP or $150). It doesn't really matter in what order you do things, you can even kill the Duntons first and then start the quest (though you must find the scorpion limbs before you can report the rebranded brahmins).

{{< note >}}Once you have proven the brothers guilt and leave the Klamath map, they will be gone forever.{{< /note >}}

You can also confront the Duntons about the evidence you found, as long as you haven't reported the rebranded brahmins to Ardin yet. You need a speech of at least 51% to get the option to do so peacefully (250 XP). If you fail they will turn hostile and you will have to fight them. Keeping that in mind, you might want to confront them while you're on the grazing area map or in their home, because if you are in the Golden Gecko and that happens, all the people there will turn hostile as well. Once you have confronted them, they will no longer talk to you.

## 2. An alternate way to kill the rat god

A new solution to an old quest. 4 of the wooden support beams near where Keeng Ra'at is usually found will display the 'use' icon when you examine them. Placing an explosive near one of these supports will collapse part of the cave. You get 600 XP for doing this instead of 300 XP for killing him in a fight. Be sure to get the car part and the hidden pistol first because these areas will be blocked off after the collapse.
