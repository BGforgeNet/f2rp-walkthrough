# EPA

There's three ways of getting this location on your map. First is by recruiting Myron and then try to dump him, he will then tell you of this location. The second way is from a [random traveler](/random-encounters/#a-traveler) somewhere close to New Reno, and the third way is by doing a quest for [Dr. Sheng](/san-francisco/#1-investigate-the-whereabouts-of-dr-sheng). You will need a rope here, so don't forget to bring one.

When you arrive you will be greeted by a horde of spore plants spread out on most of the map. If you are alone you can easily cruise in between them, but if you have a party with you, they might want to run around and take them all out. It can be a pretty long fight.

To the left of the entrance you will find a white shed containing some useful items like a can of plant spray. If you equip it and use it on a plant it will die instantly. If you run out you can find another can in the garage (storage shed) just north of the shed, but unless your lockpicking skill is high you will have to wait with it until later. In one of the lockers inside the white shed you can also find a big metal pole, you might want to grab it (you never know when one might come in handy). There's also several pieces of junk spread out on the map, feel free to grab one.

{{< note >}}The locked storage shed contains a few odds and ends but nothing special except for one thing, if you have Dogmeat in your party and like to keep him alive that is. There are some cans of dog food there. Use the dog food on Dogmeat and he regains full health when injured. (I don't know whether it works like the first aid kit and disappears randomly after using it, or if it lasts forever.){{< /note >}}

When you enter the main building you will notice that the elevators are broken but luckily you can go down through the right elevator shaft. All you need is a bit of rope... Note that Skynet and all of the dogs cannot go down with you, but they will wait for you here until you come back. Oh, and there's a locker with some stimpaks on the left side of the main building and a computer giving you a little bit of information on all the levels of the EPA, otherwise nothing much of interest.

Going down the elevator shaft will take you to EPA's Air, Water and Power Facility level. It's crawling with rats, mantis and small scorpions. There are a few lockers here containing a super toolkit, an electronic lockpick and a couple of books. Going through here you might notice that one of the four power generators is not working properly, though you don't know quite why so you better leave it. On the northern wall there are three big vents, if you go close to the middle one you'll find out that it's just big enough to squeeze through. Only problem is that big spinning metal fan. Here's where that metal pole comes in handy, use it to jam the fan.

The vent leads you to the maintenance level which has two working elevators, on to the north-west and one to the north-east. The only points of interest here are a locker with a laser pistol and a depressed Mr Handy robot walking around.

Here's the layout of the EPA sub-levels (shamelessly copied and modified from SoldierOfTruth):

East Elevators with appropriate sub levels - Abbreviated by the letter E and followed by the number of the sub-level:

- E1 - **Red Level**, East Sub-level 1
- E2 - **Violet Level**, East Sub-level 2
- E3 - **Green Level**, East Sub-level 3

West Elevators with appropriate sub levels - Abbreviated by the letter W and followed by the number of the sub-level:

- W1 - **Orange level**, West Sub-level 1
- W2 - **Yellow level**, West Sub-level 2
- W3 - **Indigo level**, West Sub-level 3

There's also mention of a **Blue Level**, but it doesn't exist. Or does it?

I suggest starting with the **Orange level** (conference rooms and cafeteria).

To the west you see four holograms arguing with each other seemingly stuck in a loop and you can't talk to them. As you get closer you notice the humming from a magnetic field nearby that might be interfering with them. In the room to the left of them there are a couple of computers. Use the left one and run a diagnostics check, then use repair on it (over 40%) for 100 XP. You can now talk to the holograms and get a few quests.

### 1. Fix EPA lighting problem

You get this quest from the director of public relations (female holo), but first you have to try to open one of a few password protected doors, and ask her for the password. The closest door is the one to the room just south of her. You also need speech 81% (actually you only need 61% but then you will have to ask her twice). She wants you to repair the power generator located in EPA's Air, Water and Power Facility level. It's the left one of the four generators. With a repair skill bigger than 55% you'll learn that you need to fix it with a piece of junk (500 XP). Return to her to get the password.

{{< note >}}I suggest you do this quest first as several doors will be locked to you otherwise.{{< /note >}}

### 2. Clear out the plant problem

Hologram 10031 is the man in charge of the ground maintenance but he's having trouble with controlling the robots and as a holo he can't do anything himself. He'll employ you as assistant groundskeeper and wants you to clear out all the spore plants on the top level. If you already did it earlier you can just tell him that. He gives you 500 XP and the keys to his storage shed (the locked building on the top level).

You may want to consider waiting with this quest until after you have gotten the "Test the Solar Scorcher for the Director of Science." quest.

### 3. Fix the Voice Computer

The obnoxious power armor wearing hologram is the director of security for EPA. Talking to him reveals that he has no control over the robots as the voice computer is malfunctioning. If you fix it for him he'll grant you access to the security wing (Red level).

The EPA Robot control computer is located in the Yellow level. It's the one that says "BEEP!" from time to time. You need to run a diagnostic check to determine what's wrong and then repair it (76%, or 56% when using a tool or a super tool kit) for 500 XP. Returning to the director of security, you will get an access card that unlocks most doors on the Red level.

{{< note >}}The fourth hologram (director of operations) is completely useless. There's nothing you can do with him.{{< /note >}}

{{< note >}}In one of the fridges in the cafeteria section, you can find a bag of Pop Rocks, and there's a cooler with some Nuka-Cola. If you take them together (equip the Pop Rocks and use them on yourself, then do the same with the Nuka-Cola), you will get a funny sequence. It's best if you surround yourself with eventual NPCs. Saving before doing this is highly recommended.{{< /note >}}

{{< note >}}To the North there is a room with some mutated fruit flies, it's full of chemicals and is highly toxic. It's recommended to wait going in there until you have proper protective gear as it can be quite deadly. Besides, there's nothing there.{{< /note >}}

## Yellow Level

This level is connected with the Violet level via a room full of chemicals that is very toxic. It is much better to enter that room from the Violet level than the Yellow, unless you are already wearing protective gear.

### 4. Fix hologram 00000

The hologram here is the Director of Science. Speaking to him reveals a small problem, he only talks in binary. You need 100% science and IN 6 to understand him. He says there is a problem with the tape reel close by him (81% to repair it, 51% if you use any kind of tool). But that's not enough, he also needs to be rebooted (talking to him with 100% science and intelligence 6 will make you able to understand what's wrong). 500 XP is your reward.

### 5. Test the Solar Scorcher for the Director of Science

{{< note >}}The Solar Scorcher is the same gun that could previously be found in the [Guardian of Forever](/random-encounters/#guardian-of-forever) encounter.{{< /note >}}

After you have fixed the science director he wants you to test out an experimental weapon for him. It is stored in a locker next to the tape reel machine. The locker is locked until you get this quest and there is no way of opening it before that. Anyway, your mission is to go outside and shoot something and then come back and report it (500 XP), and you get to keep the gun. Note, outside means outside, critters in the sub-levels don't count. Ideally you saved a spore plant on the surface level for target practice, if not you have to travel the wastes.

## Indigo Level

No quests here but there are a few things of interest.

{{< note >}}In the room directly south of the elevator there is a beeping computer. It holds a few interesting notes, especially the ones on a cure for epilepsy. After you have gotten that info you can 'cure' the barking man in New Reno (100 XP and 3 Stimpaks). If you push the "keep searching" option 22 times you will eventually find info on a Mass Fluoridation Project (200 XP). With Luck 9 you can find the hidden message a little faster.{{< /note >}}

{{< note >}}The room just below the computer holds three modified auto-doc machines. Using these will let you change your appearance. As a male you can go from normal hair, to long hair, to completely bald. You can even have that sex-change operation you've always dreamt about. Females can change between blonde, red head and the normal 'bucket head' brunette, plus the sex change. For now... but more hero models are in the works for both men and women, just hope they find their way to the RP when done.{{< /note >}}

{{< warning >}}The machines can be very dangerous! Saving prior to use is advisable.{{< /warning >}}

{{< note >}}In a room to the far left is a silver toaster sitting on a desk. Apparently his name is "Brave Little Toaster". You can have a little chat with him. It turns out he's desperate to make you a toast, as it's been a century since he last made any. But that's not why you are here. As everything else here he is in need of repairs (fairly easy repair roll, 450 XP), and if you talk to him again you gain the ability to jinx slot machines. A handy little perk to have if you are in need of cash, as when you use it a slot machine will surrender all its money.{{< /note >}}

## Red Level

Most doors here are locked and needs to be opened with the key card you get from the director of security. In the room below the elevator is yet another broken hologram, which leads to...

### 6. Fix the hologram that speaks with static

When you try to talk to him you can't understand anything because of too much static. You need to fix the machine that controls the holographic projection (red blinking machine). IN 5 to understand you need to fix him and 51% repair to actually fix the machine, or 21% if you use any kind of tool. Talk to him again to get the password for the elevator to Blue level. This is the only way to get into it. He can also explain what a few of the things you find in the EPA are. If you can't figure it out by yourself.

{{< note >}}You can check out the museum here and even 'watch' a little flick, if that's your thing.{{< /note >}}

{{< note >}}The old electric chair here is still operational. It can be turned on via the computer in the room above the elevator. Be careful to step too close to it while it's on as it can lead to an unexpected demise. If you are feeling a little bit evil or just want to have some fun I can recommend giving your least favorite NPC a little 'push'.{{< /note >}}

{{< note >}}There are lots of lockers worth checking out here, be sure to not miss any.{{< /note >}}

## Violet Level

This level is pretty empty but this is where you find the elevator down to the Blue level. Also, in the small wall locker in the hallway to the contaminated area you will find a gas mask. If you equip it in your active item slot you will be protected from toxins and can enter the chemical areas safely (the one on this level is the only one you really need to enter). Note that this contaminated room could just as well have been covered in the Yellow level section, but since the gas mask can be found in this level it fits better here.

{{< note >}}To the right of the big computer you can see two fans that are clogged up with goo. Clean them for 50 XP each and the air becomes breathable (you no longer need the gas mask).{{< /note >}}

{{< note >}}The big computer here is "Mr. Chemmie", the local candy man. Well, not really. But if you have the knowledge and the right ingredients, he can create almost any drug you want. He can make:{{< /note >}}

| Item | Ingredients | Science Required |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| Stimpaks | Broc flower, Xander root, Empty hypo | - |
| Super stimpaks | Stimpak, Fruit, Nuka-Cola | - |
| Poison | Empty hypo, Scorpion tail, Nuka-Cola | 41% |
| Poison antidote | Scorpion tail, Booze | 46% |
| First aid kit | Stimpak, empty hypo, Poison antidote, rad away | 56% |
| Doctor's bag | Stimpak, empty hypo, Poison antidote, First aid kit | 61% |
| Buffout | First aid kit, Beer, Nuka-Cola | 71% |
| Mentats | First aid kit, Fruit, Booze | 81% |
| Psycho | Mentats, Buffout, Fruit, Stimpak | 86% |
| Rad-X | First aid kit, Nuka-Cola | 86% |

**Special options:**

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Heart Pills | If you have Cassidy in your party and science 101%, you can make these. Using them on Cassidy will 'cure' his heart problem. |
| Marijuana | Pre-war drug. CH +2, Lu +1, Pe -1 for 11 days, after 7 days you lose 1 more Pe. Science over 100% needed. |
| ERSI | A substance vital to anyone just removed from a cryo-chamber. Need to know about it before you get the option to make it. |

{{< note >}}There are some books and drugs in the lockers.{{< /note >}}

## Green Level

Here you can find EPA's botanical garden and the spectacular petting zoo. The zoo could be seen as a bit controversial, as it holds humans too. Deformed and crazed from genetic experimentation.

{{< note >}}There are no quests here, but there is one quest objective you can fulfill. On the east side there is a computer, the EPA's botany terminal. On it you can find a file on botany. If you have the quest from [Brother Paul](/abbey/#7-collect-information-about-botany-for-brother-paul) to find info on such things, you can download it to a holodisk and bring it to him. You can also extract some seeds from the seed storage tanks. They contain modified corn and some experimental seeds.{{< /note >}}

{{< note >}}If you are up for it you can take a stroll in the lush trees and bushes of the garden. If you have some seeds you can even grow one yourself. The experimental seeds can be planted in the fertile ground in the south-west corner of the garden (100 XP). If you come back three days later you will find a new random bush there (sometimes it's a spore plant).{{< /note >}}

{{< note >}}You can plant the modified corn in Arroyo for 100 XP, but it won't change anything for the village. It must be done before the fourth dream of course. The experimental seeds can be planted here too. I only managed to plant one package of seeds here even though there seems to be more fertile ground available for planting.{{< /note >}}

{{< note >}}You can read up on the different critters on the computers near their cells and lower the force fields holding them in. They are all hostile though, so the best thing you can do is probably to put them out of their misery.{{< /note >}}

## Blue Level

This is the secret level of the EPA that officially is non-existent. You get down here by an elevator on the Violet level, but first you need the password that is given to you by a hologram on the Red level.

When you get down here you will exit on a platform surrounded by a pack of wanamingos. If you paid attention to the hole in the wall in the wanamingo holding cell on the Green level, well, this is where they escaped to. If you stand around for too long they will walk through a hole in the fence and attack.

The big force field that is blocking your way up ahead can be lowered by using repair on the computer to the right of it. You need a pretty high skill here, repair 100% will give you an overall chance of 20%. You can try however many times you like though. A well placed explosive in front of the computer can accomplish the same thing if you aren't skilled enough.

Up the stairs you will find a room with three hibernation chambers. They all contain possible NPC recruits. The computer just inside the door has information on all of them and from here you can extract one of them. Whom it will be is up to you. When the computer warns that you need a can of ERSI, you can run up to Mr Chemmie to get one, or you can just ignore it and see what happens. Mr Chemmie cannot create the ERSI up until now, no matter what your skill.

{{< note >}}Behind every hibernation chamber is a locker for each NPC. When you extract a NPC from the chamber his or her locker will also be unlocked. The other lockers will remain locked and there is no way for you to open them.{{< /note >}}

{{< note >}}Do not miss to check out the footlocker in this room, it contains amongst other things a special syringe. When used you gain a permanent +1 AG.{{< /note >}}

## The New NPCs from EPA

### Kitsune

Need charisma of at least 5, or CH 2 or more + speech higher than 80% for her to join you. You only get one shot, if you fail she's gone for good. She is, well was a Chinese spy working for the Americans. If you ask her about her past you can eventually get her to teach you some of her skills. You gain +10% to your sneak, lockpick and steal skills.

Her main skill is lockpicking, and as long as her skill is better than yours, she will help you with it (like Vic with repair). As for combat skills, she's best with unarmed, melee, small guns and throwing - in that order. She can use all weapons, but she's rather bad with energy and big guns. She starts out with 80 HP and ends up with 130 HP and her AP will always be the 9 she starts with.

If you have left her out of your party and try to get her back while having CH 1, she will leave and disappear for good.

### Cat Jules

He used to be in the army, but was reassigned to guard duty at the EPA where he volunteered to some human/feline DNA experimentation. (He's basically a tribute to Cat, a character from the British Sci-Fi-comedy series "Red Dwarf".) If you ask he can give you some weapon training (+10% to small guns, Big Guns and Energy Weapons).

Notable skills; Small Guns, Energy Weapons, Unarmed, melee and on his final level a passable Big Guns skill. He can use all weapons, though he's not very good at throwing. He starts out with 80 HP and ends up with 130 HP, and his AP starts at 8 and ends at 10 on his last level.

Same as with Kitsune, if you ever have a CH of 1 when you try to recruit him or pick him up again, he will vanish from the game.

### Dex

A sociopathic killer and worse according to his files, innocent according to himself (He would say that wouldn't he?). If you play an evil character (negative karma) he will not pretend to be innocent. In fact, if you ask for his life's story, he'll tell you all about it. Good characters will never get to know, but maybe its better that way. He is easy to anger before you've recruited him, so pick your lines carefully or he'll go hostile. If you ask him if he can give you any tips, he'll teach you +15% speech and barter.

His main skill is speech, but unfortunately he cannot help you with that in any way. He's also good with Melee and Unarmed. Small guns are OK and Energy Weapons and throwing skill are passable on his last level. Unfortunately the weapons he can use are limited to unarmed, knives, pistols and sub-machine guns. He starts out with 80 HP and ends up with 130 HP, and his AP will stay the 8 he starts with until his last level, when it when it changes to 9.

{{< note >}}Female characters have the option to sleep with him before he is recruited. If you are good or neutral though (0 to positive karma), he will kill you afterward. So maybe not such a good idea.{{< /note >}}

{{< note >}}Dex carries a pack of cigarettes. I thought I should mention it in case you haven't come across any before. Male characters can smoke if they also have a lighter in their inventory.{{< /note >}}
