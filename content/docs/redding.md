## Cure Fannie of her jet addiction (not available to female characters)

Fannie Mae is a 'hostess' working in the Malamute Saloon. After you pay for her services, ($60) she will tell you a sad story and ask for even more money to pay off a debt she owes. If you give her the $200 she wants, Lou will tell you that you are not helping Fannie any because she is addicted to Jet. Once you get the Jet Antidote from Dr. Troy in Vault City (or San Francisco), you can ask Lou to slip it into Fannies drink. This will earn you 1000xp.

To make Fannie OD, do the same things as above, until you give Fannie the $200. After that talk to her again and she will tell you she needs even more money. If you give her the $150 she asks for she will eventually OD. Leave the map and when you come back Fannie Mae is gone. Talk to Lou and she tells you you're an "idjit", but nothing else happens.
