# Raiders

The Raiders base is now impossible to find except for two ways:

a. Get the map from Bishop's safe. (You need to 'use' it from inventory.)

b. Exit Vault City to the world map on foot sometime between 18:00 and 6.00, and you have a chance of spotting the raiders. The higher outdoorsman the better, but since you can enter/exit until you get it, you don't need a very high skill (31% is minimum and with 40% you should make it in 10 tries at least). You have to have talked to Sergeant Stark about the raiders before this option becomes available.

When you choose to follow the raiders, there is another outdoorsman check to decide which entrance to the raiders you get. One is through a cave (bad) and one through a well (good). Again, you don't need a high outdoorsman skill, but it will give you a better chance for getting to the well entrance.

(If you choose the second option to find the Raiders base, you will have to leave your car behind and walk back to wherever you left it.)

Only when you enter through the well can you end the raider threat peacefully. Climb down and sneak to the tribal "Shadow Who Walks" and talk to him. Convince him to stop working for the raiders. (3000xp and 15 karma)

You can also threaten him instead and tell him to run out of the Raiders camp, for 2500xp and 15 karma.

If you leave after talking to "Shadow Who Walks" the raiders will all leave and there will only be containers to loot.
