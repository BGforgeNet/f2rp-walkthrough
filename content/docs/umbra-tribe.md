# Umbra Tribe

If Sulik is with you when you come here, he will effectively leave the party to stay and talk with his old friends. You will need to wait a day or 2 before talking to him and asking him to travel with you again. Don't leave any important inventory items with him unless you plan on trying to steal or buy them back.

## 1. Find out what's haunting the tribe's shaman

You get this quest by just talking to the shaman. You need to talk (listen) to the spirit of the dead girl in the wilderness area to the South. She will be there at night time once you have started this quest. Back at the shaman's tent, talk to the shaman again and help him hold a ceremony that finishes this quest, for 500 XP.

## 2. Accompany Krom to meet with the trader

In the NE tent is Krom, the leader of the tribe's warriors. He is on his way to make a deal with a shady trader and wants your "worldly" guidance. You will accompany him and decide if he should make a deal or not. You can investigate the crate of merchandise before you make your decision. With a perception of 7 you can find out that the stimpaks are fake.

So depending on how you make the trade this is what you get:

- 600 XP +20 karma for figuring out the stimpaks were fake and stop the deal.
- 500 XP + 15 karma if you make the deal.
- 300 XP + 15 karma if you find out about the fake stimpaks and kill the trader.
- 300 XP if you kill the trader for no good reason.

{{< note >}}Female characters can have a little romance with Krom before they take on this mission (charisma 7).{{< /note >}}

## 3. Fix the well for Marli and the tribe

The guy standing next to the well gives you this quest. You need a rope for this and there is none to be found around here, so be sure to bring one with you. Also pick up the nearby bucket. You need to first use the rope on the well and then use the bucket on it too. You get 400 XP and $150 when you talk to him again.

{{< note >}}If you are carrying a 10mm SMG when you report the fixed well to Marli, he will notice and ask to have it. You only get 50 XP and a nuka cola if you give it to him, so unless you have a spare it's not really worth it. If he gets the SMG he will run off and won't be back until you have defeated the Enclave (in case you'd miss him).{{< /note >}}

## 4. Sulik's sister is missing, find her

You get this quest from Sulik. Metzger, in the Den, will put the location of the Slaver's Camp on your map when you ask him about his business. (Speech 51% required). The slaves that you free from Metzger will also tell you where the camp is, in case your speech skill isn't good enough. Freeing Kurisu from the camp automatically takes you to the Umbra Tribe. How to free her is covered in the [Slaver's Camp](/docs/slavers-camp/) section.

## 5. Find out what happened to the hunting party

You must complete the "Find out what is haunting the tribe's shaman" quest before you can do this one. I also had to wait a day or two before Krom the leader of the warriors would give me this quest. Talk to the guy guarding the cave and he will let you in. In there you have the choice of attacking the gecko or wait and see what happens. If you don't attack the gecko, the injured hunter will die and you will get no XP for the quest (you will also be unable to get quest nr.7). After you kill the Golden Gecko and listen to Serin's story, you need to help him out from the cave. If you are a good doctor you can heal his leg on the spot, or if you are strong you can carry him out (Sulik can also do it for you if he's in your party). Else you will have to leave him in the cave and go to get help. 600 XP when you get back to the village map.

## 6. Collect firewood for the tribe's fishermen

The woman in front of the tent in the fishermen's area will give you this quest. There are at least 4 piles of firewood in the wilderness south of the village. Bring her 3 of them for 200 XP, or $75 and 125 XP.

## 7. Get medicinal plants for the shaman

After you rescue Serin, the injured hunter, you will appear in front of the shaman's tent. The shaman will thank you, then you can ask him if there is anything else you can do. He will tell you to bring him 5 Xander root and 3 Broc flowers. You get 100 XP and some healing powder for giving them to him.
