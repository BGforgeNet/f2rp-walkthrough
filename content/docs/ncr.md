# NCR

## Ranger Safe Houses

There is a map on a table in the back room of the building where you meet the Rangers in NCR. 'Using' this map will put the locations of the 3 safe houses on your world map.

## 1. Wipe out the Rangers' safe houses to the north, for Vortis the slaver

If you are a slaver, have a karma of less than -250 or if you have the cult of personality perk, you get this quest from Vortis when you deliver the Ranger's map to him. Travel to all the safe houses and take them out for a $1000. If you have speech over 80% you can ask for some assistance in taking them out (there's a speech roll here so sometimes you won't get any help). This is preferable since you are then transported automatically between the safe houses (even though Vortis men only seem to stick around for the first fight). If they are with you, you also get the option to double-cross them and side with the rangers. Vortis won't know and the rangers will stay alive until you decide otherwise, but this option is mostly for good guys with the cult of personality perk I guess.

## 2. Wipe out the [Slaver's Camp](/docs/slavers-camp/) to the north west, for the Rangers

You can learn the location from Metzger (speech 61%) or from one of his slaves after you've freed them. Both require that you have talked to Sulik and gotten the "[Find Sulik's sister](/docs/umbra-tribe/#4-suliks-sister-is-missing-find-her)" quest first. You then have the choice of going directly to the camp to wipe it out, or going to NCR and tell the Rangers about it. You can persuade the Rangers to assist you if you need some extra help taking care of business. Either way you do it, report back to the Rangers for 800 XP.

{{< note >}}If you give the map to Vortis (to fulfill his quest), the Rangers at the safe houses will all be dead when you arrive (unless you start his second quest but don't finish it). It's possible to wipe out the Ranger safe houses first, before joining the Rangers and get their help in taking out Metzger's slave camp (possible bug?). You may encounter angry Rangers, even if you joined the Rangers, killed Vortis, and have otherwise been playing a good character.{{< /note >}}

It is now possible to enter the BOS bunker here, after you have delivered the vertibird plans to Matthew in San Francisco. There are a couple of lockers in there containing a brotherhood armor, a sniper rifle, some ammo and meds.

## An alternative way to assassinate Westin

You can now kill him in a little more subtle manner. To get this option you must first talk to Dr. Jubilee about heart pills and get him to mention something about "pecker pills". To do that, go to doc Jubilee's and look at his shelf first (open it) before you talk to him. You also get the option to talk about heart pills, if you manage to steal them or get caught trying to steal them. Don't get your hopes up trying to buy them from him, as it's just not possible.

After that you can go to Reno and get the 'pecker pills' from Renesco for $200. If you question his price he will raise it to $300. When he has raised the price, you can convince him to make them for free if you remind him about the 'Wright affair' or say you helped him with Salvatore (depending on how you handled those quests of course). Don't mention Bishop, as if you do, he will no longer make the pills for you.

Then all that is left is to go back to NCR and replace or put the fake pills in Dr. Jubilee's shelf. Westin will die in up to 14 days, depending on how long it is until his next medical pickup. Dr. Jubilee will let you know when that is if you ask if he's reconsidered selling the pills.

Be sure to have finished everything on the ranch map before Westin dies, if you intend to go there, as afterward you will not be let in. Note that as of now you have to be in NCR (same map as Dr. Jubilee) on the day Westin is supposed to die or the day count will start over (bug).
