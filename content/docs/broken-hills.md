# Broken Hills

## 1. Determine whether Chad is skimming money from the caravan runs

You get this task by talking to Marcus. Go talk to the caravan guards and find Max, the only guy in green armor. Max will say that he knows Chad is guilty, and keeps accurate records of it in his house. If you confront Chad at this point, he will deny everything. Talk more with Max and it turns out that he designed the complicated lock on the door, and tells you how to unlock it. Chad's house is on the far end on the E side of town. Unlock the door and check the desk for a briefcase.

If your perception is less than 7 or, your intelligence is 4 or lower, Chad will appear behind you while you search through his drawer. After a short conversation he will turn hostile. He seems to be a wuss though (if you are wearing anything better than leather he is likely to run away). If you look in the drawer again after the fight you'll find the briefcase there.

Once you have the briefcase, there are 2 ways to complete the quest. You can confront Chad with the evidence and blackmail him. He'll pay $1000 for you to let him get out of town and you get 750 XP. The other way is to tell Marcus. You won't get the money, but you'll get 1500 XP instead. If you want to blackmail Chad you have two chances. First you must pass a speech check (skill -15%), fail that and you get another speech roll (skill -35%).

You can now tell Marcus about the NCR scientist's mutant experiments. If you have already recruited him, you can still tell him about it as long as you are in Broken Hills. Marcus will thank you and tell you he'll never forget, with minor XP reward. The caravan run to NCR will get canceled for fear of poisoned goods.

Marcus now has a new line unlocked for when you have found the tunnels but not yet found the dead bodies (nothing major, just flavor).

If you have the gas mask from the EPA, it will protect you from the damaging gas in the mine.

If you are playing with the NPC Armor Mod installed, you can obtain a Kevlar Armor for Dogmeat here. Talk to Liz in the hardware store and ask her if she has something special off the shelves. She will set you up for a mere $2000, but only if you have the dog in your party. Talk to Dogmeat to put it on or off. When Dogmeat is fully leveled up and is wearing the armor, he will have the equivalent protection of a combat armor, with a little bit better laser resistance.

{{< note >}}There is no one with Combat armor in Broken Hills. For those that need additional help finding Max, he is the one wearing green-looking leather armor, standing right outside near the back door, and the ONLY person in that area that is NOT wearing black leather.{{< /note >}}
