# The Den

'Petey' is a druggie that shows up in a forced encounter asking for money. Giving him some cash ($5) will raise your karma 1 point. This only works the first time, so don't bother giving him more. (You don't lose karma by refusing.)

## 1. Find a way to get the orphans off the street

This quest begins by talking to the poor kid, Bobby, in the SW of Den Residential who lives with his abusive father. If you listen to his story and feel sorry for him, you'll find out that Mom is the one who could help. Go talk to Mom. She'll tell you there is a big building in the residential area that would make a good orphanage, but it's full of squatters that need to be taken care of. You can kill the squatters (500xp), get them to leave peacefully (750xp), or, make a deal with them to help out at the orphanage in return for room and board (1000xp). The latter 2 options seem to take Speech skill higher than 80%, so save your game and try a few times. Tell Mom the squatters are out. She'll say to return in a few days and the orphanage will be set up - meaning no more thieving little beggars in front of every door. (You must actually visit the orphanage for the thieving children to stop appearing.)

Also, stop by and see how little Bobby is doing. You'll receive an extra 500xp for helping him find a better life.

## 2. Return Anna's locket

This is not a new quest, only a new item. The diary is found in the bookshelf behind Anna (the one with a shovel lying in front of it). Looking at it in inventory will give you the clues needed to solve Anna's quest (if you didn't already know), then 'Use' the diary for 100xp.

## 3. Help Lara attack Tyler's gang

This is another original quest that has changed. Instead of having to fight all of the gang at once, you only have to fight some of them at the church. After that battle is over, Lara will ask you to go with her to the party in Den Residential and fight the rest of the gang. You can take time to rest and heal first, but you cannot get out of finishing the job. You will then need to go back to the church to talk to Lara and receive payment.

It is now possible to enter the BOS bunker here, after you have delivered the vertibird plans to Matthew in San Francisco. There's a locker in there containing a brotherhood armor, a combat shotgun, some ammo and meds.
