# Navarro

If you stowawayed on the vertibird from the desert transaction in New Reno you will end up here. The crewmen will find you when you reach the landing pad here and you get the option to jump out and fight or to surrender. If you surrender you will be taken to the base commander for questioning. You can answer some of his questions and ask some yourself but after that he'll try to kill you. Whatever you do there is no way out of it, you will have to fight.

{{< warning >}}If you go here unprepared or too early into the game this is pretty much a suicide run. I would recommend being taken to the base commander as you start off alone with him, and you can escape a lot easier from there.{{< /warning >}}
