# Vault City

## 1. Resolve the problem with the nearby village

Once you finish exploring around Gecko and scouting the route to NCR, Sgt. Stark will put this village on your map and ask you to go kill the mole rats there. Kill all the mole rats and report back to Stark (for 800 XP + kills and $750). It has to be done within a month after you get the quest or the villagers will all be taken away and enslaved by Vault City (the quest will be scratched off when you talk to Stark again).

If you instead talk to a resident you'll learn that the mole rats are the only reason Vault City hasn't invaded to take them all prisoner. There is a better and more peaceful way of solving the problem (worth 1000 XP). It's very intertwined with the first quest for the [Vault Village](/docs/vault-village/), so it will be covered there instead.

Cassidy now has a talking head thanks to 'Continuum' and is excellently voiced by 'Dravean', if you chose those options in the RP installer.
