# Gecko

You can provoke an Enclave vertibird assault by using the computer in the reactor. This must be done before anything else you choose to do with the reactor. The commands to enter are:

- a. Action:
- b. Some kind of network . . .
- c. Access Codes, X, Y, Z
- d. List other stations
- e. [more]
- f. Everything is shut down except for the ENCLAVE . . .

He can't see you, so have as much fun with the talking head as you please. He will send a team to find you anyway. The encounter should happen shortly after you leave Gecko, but might be random. You can try to talk your way out, (speech skill greater than 85%) or fight them.

If you chose to install the new Lenny model, here is where you will find it. It looks good, but I choose not to use it for two reasons. First, he now uses rifles instead of pistols and submachine guns, and secondly, he has no running animations. That means he's real slow, always falling behind. Also, if you give him a radioactive drink he will start to glow, and if you give him a radaway he will stop (this also works with the old Lenny model).
