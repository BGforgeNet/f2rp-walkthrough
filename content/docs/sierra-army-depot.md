# Sierra Army Depot

If you contaminate SAD by extracting (dropping) a virus, this will now prevent the Wright family from gaining access. This means that they won't be able to take over New Reno with arms anymore (they can still do it peacefully though). If you want to bring Skynet with you, you have to extract the virus before you extract the brain, since the robot explodes after fetching the brain. After the virus has been dropped you only have a few minutes until the place is completely contaminated, but it's enough to assemble Skynet and get the hell out of there.

The repair bay at Sierra Army depot now repairs hurt bots or replaces destroyed ones. This will occur on any level of the Sierra Army Depot.
