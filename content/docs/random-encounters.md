# Random Encounters

## Miscellaneous

Playing the Restoration Project mod, you will find there is a much higher probability of having encounters when crossing the Wastelands. Early in the game, this will be a real nuisance and often a nightmare, running into dangerous situations your character is not at all prepared to deal with. It was killap's intention to bring the game closer to what it was originally - you should be afraid of venturing into the wastes. Read those scout manuals, and put a few points into outdoorsman skill and you shouldn't have much trouble. (The encounter rate is dependent upon your computer however, and it can be adjusted. So, if it seems unbearable, check the wiki at [Vault - Tec Labs](https://falloutmods.wikia.com/wiki/F2RP_Technical_Info) for help changing it)

Not only will you have more encounters, there are also many that never existed before. Robbers and raiders could always be certain death for low level parties, but a caravan fending off robbers can be a great opportunity. If you can keep your NPCs out of the fight, wait until the robbers start running out of ammo and then take them down. Some of the weapons you can pick up (for free, and still far away from any town where you could even buy them - if you could afford to,) will almost seem like cheating.

## Kaga

The first time you meet Kaga is likely to happen shortly after leaving Arroyo and heading to Klamath (or there about). Mynoc, in Arroyo, can tell you even more information about Kaga if you ask him. Basically he was once Arroyos greatest warrior, but got bad influences from outside and became a wicked person. He cheated in the Temple of trials and got cast out of the tribe. He now carries a grudge...

There are potentially 5 times you will be confronted by Kaga and his companions, and each time they are better equipped than the time before. He will attack you after a brief chat the first time, after that the moment he sees you. If he is hit too much he will try to escape, but his friends will stay on. If he's unconscious or for some other reason fails to escape and you kill him, you will naturally not get any more encounters with him.

The 5 Kaga encounters occur as follows:

- 1st encounter: Most likely to get this in the ocean - Arroyo - Klamath area, also the Klamath - Den trade route.
- 2nd encounter: Player level greater than 4. Likely encountered in Bandits Pass and areas around Modoc.
- 3rd encounter: Player level greater than 8. Most commonly found in areas patrolled by the Raiders.
- 4th encounter: Player level greater than 12. Most likely found in the NCR area.
- 5th encounter: Player level greater than 16. Found in areas around San Francisco and trade route to Redding.

{{< note >}}Kaga's escape is not always working correctly. Sometimes he will start to run away and then just stand still and do nothing, even if you shoot him. Once you end combat though he will disappear properly. So if this happens you will just have to decide if you want more encounters with him later and then leave him alone for the rest of the fight, or if you rather want him dead now.{{< /note >}}

## A Traveler

The Traveler is sometimes worth stopping to talk to (the first few times). She never has anything to barter with, but I have had her give me the location of several places I would normally need to find out about from someone else, including EPA and the Military Base. She doesn't know the real names of the places though, so you have to ask about "an abandoned mine" and "an old research facility" to have her put the locations on your map.

## Federation Shuttle

You can now find a phaser pistol here. This uses small energy cells, clip capacity = 12 shots, damage = 20-30, range = 25.

## Guardian of Forever

The Solar Scorcher has been removed and can now be found at the EPA instead. See the [EPA](/docs/epa/) section if you need help obtaining it.

## Vorpal Rat Cave

You may find this place after already encountering Arthur and the Knights searching for the Holy Hand Grenade.

Here you will find the 5 nobles fighting with the seemingly invulnerable rat. Neither the rat nor knights seem to pay any attention to your party as long as you don't join the fight. This battle can take a long time, and end in different ways. The first time I had this encounter, the rat managed to kill all 5. It then came after me, and I somehow killed it with one targeted shot to the head with a Desert Eagle. (for 0xp.) The second time, all 5 knights were able to survive and eventually kill the rat.

In either situation, you can use your action points during the battle to enter the cave and collect the Holy Hand Grenade. What interests me more is that they each carry $500 and over 100 large energy cells (depending upon how much ammo they have used in battle) which is nice to loot or steal.

## Star Wars Easter Egg

A tribute to the creator(s) and contributors of/to the Restoration Project. It's only available after you have beaten the game (you will automatically get it shortly after leaving San Francisco). I suggest you run around and talk to all the people there. Some might give you little gifts, if nothing else.

- Obi-Wan-Killap - Green Lightsaber, 36-76 damage. Only very good characters get this (Savior of the Damned, +1001 karma).
- Emperor Timeslip - Red Lightsaber, 36-76 damage. Only very evil characters get this (Demon Spawn, -1001 karma).
- Also, both good and evil players can get 10,000xp for learning the force. Ahem, I mean the source.
- Hivan Zolo - Blaster, 30-40 damage, 3 AP, Min ST 3, Rng 24, ammo: 40 small energy cells (you need an energy weapon skill of 101% to get it though).
