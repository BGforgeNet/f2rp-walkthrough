# Modoc

There are no changes to the plot or quests here, but something else that is new because of the Restoration Project, and this is the first (maybe the only) location where it is likely to happen.

As killap mentions in the RP read me, your character, and NPCs can now take damage from the outhouse explosion and/or falling through the trap at the Ghost Farm. While this may not be immediately apparent, if you suddenly notice that you are unable to run, or that your NPC characters are avoiding combat, it is a good chance that someone has a crippled limb. And if you pay attention, your NPCs will actually complain when they are suffering broken limbs now.

Unlike hit points, crippled limbs do not heal over time. You will need doctor skill in order to solve this problem, as first aid will not help. If your doctor skill is low, you can try it several times and hope to be successful. The doctors bag will help also. If not, then you will need to find a doctor (maybe Vault City) that can heal the broken limbs.

As of now there are two new crippled messages appearing on screen, just like "addicted" or "level". The new ones say "Crippled" and "NPC Crippled", so now you have no excuse for not knowing.
