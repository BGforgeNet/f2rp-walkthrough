# Enclave

## 1. Set off the nuke on the Presidential level

You must have the Presidential Access Key and the red keycard from a scientist on the reactor level (the one with the Enclave soldier right next to him). When you have both keys, use the control panel next to the bomb.

{{< warning >}}There doesn't seem to be a way to successfully set the bomb, it always blows up in 5 seconds. Save your game before you mess with the nuke!{{< /warning >}}

*"Bomb has been activated and will detonate in T-minus 5 min . . Error in countdown procedure. Countdown restarted at T-minus 5 seconds. Please make sure you are at least 80 miles from the blast area. Have a great day."*
