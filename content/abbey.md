# Abbey

Father Tully in New Reno will tell you about this place and put it on your map. He'll also give you quest 5 below. You can find it just by exploring if you want to get here earlier, but you won't get quest 5 until you talk to Tully.

## 1. Kill the beast beneath the church

You must ask the head monk on the third floor about a GECK in order to get this quest. He will then send you to look for Brother Thomas and a missing book in the basement.

In the basement are a few mutated rats, several Radscorpions, and a big tough Deathclaw you will need to fight through to find the body of Thomas, and the book. (for 500 XP + kills) Get the book from the corpse of Thomas and take it to the head monk for 200 XP. (or $250 and 0 XP if you sell it to him.) Paul will then give you an access card for the computer. Be sure to have the book when you report back to the head monk. He will only ask you for it once. (You can get the access card and 50 XP by killing the Deathclaw, but the book is useless to you.)

{{< note >}}If you talk to the Abbot about the purpose of the order and pursue that dialog tree you can convince him to use some of their knowledge to help people for 200 XP (speech over 90% required).{{< /note >}}

## 2. Deliver the machine part to Brother Max

Elaine, the 'stout nun' on the second floor will give you this task. Max is in the copying room in the E section of the basement. To get there, look for the door on the ground behind the guy preaching in the large chapel area. Max will give you a scout manual and 100 XP.

## 3. Repair the water pump and report the status to the head monk

Talk to the head monk or Dave, the merchant, to find out the water pump needs to be fixed. After examining the pump and discovering it needs a motor (this gives you 100 XP) talk to Dave again. He'll say you can find a motor at Harry's in Vault City (which will cost you $500). When you have the motor, you can talk to him again. He will ask if you want him to fix the pump (300 XP) or if you want to do it (800 XP). If you do it, use the motor on the pump first. You will then get a message saying that perhaps tools would help. Pliers or a super tool kit will work. (There are pliers on the bookcase closest to the door in Trader Bill's shop. A wrench does not work) Report back to the head monk for another 50 XP.

## 4. Find out who is digging up the graves

Samuel, the gravekeeper will give you this quest, along with a clue to solving it. Talk to the farmer, Mr. Peterson to the South. Wait until midnight and talk to the old man around the graveyard carrying a shovel. His name is Tom and he's so poor he has to steal food and rob graves for a living. Tell him to go ask Mr. Peterson for help, and get 1000 XP. Talk to Tom again and he'll give you a lighter which could come in handy for quest 6.

## 5. Inform Brother Thomas and father Tully about the whereabouts of each other

When you get back to New Reno, you receive 750 XP experience for telling father Tully that Samuel was fine. You can get 500 XP more for bringing him a bottle of Abbey wine, which can be obtained from one of the monks in the W side of the basement.

## 6. Bring a lighter to brother Hank

Hank is the moonshiner in the W basement. Officer Darrow in VC Amenities "A" has a lighter for sale. One of Becky's male guards in the Den has one to steal also. Give it to Hank in the basement for 0 XP. He will give you a free bottle of the Abbey wine for Father Tully.

## 7. Collect information about botany for Brother Paul

Brother Paul (referred to as computer monk) is the man in a gray robe in the library on the second floor. You can get a quest to find info on botany from him (science 70%). You can find it on a computer in the [EPA](/epa/) and copy it over to a holodisk. Once you have it, talk to Brother Paul again. He will tell you to upload the data to the main Abbey computer. If you have received the access card from him already, log on to the terminal and "add information" for 750 XP. Else you have to do the "Kill the beast beneath the church." quest first to get it.

## 8. Escort Brother Jason to Gecko

You can find Jason outside, between the church and the cemetery. He's a "Tragic: The Gathering" addict. He is not happy at the Abbey and would want to leave. If you have been to Gecko you can offer to escort him there. (800 XP and a stealth boy).

## 9. Format the Abbey's book database

You can also get this from Brother Jason (but you can't do both this and quest 8). He's tired of the brothers ways and thinks erasing the database will force them to change. First you need to do quest 1 to gain access to the computers though. You get 500 XP and -5 karma for this. Don't bother coming back to him as he will not give you any reward (he will "pretend" to be hostile so as to not reveal he had something to do with it.)

## Other activities

{{< note >}}Brother John on the second floor has a bad heart. If you give him [heart pills](/epa/#violet-level) he will give you a Scout Handbook, or you can charge him $400. You can also pretend to sell them to him for $400 but refuse to turn them over, after which he won't speak to you anymore. Neither choice affects karma or town reputation, and the other monks don't care what you do.{{< /note >}}

{{< note >}}In the lower left corner of the abbey, you will find Jack the healer. As his title suggests, he can fix you up (no NPCs). If you ask him for medical supplies you'll get a paramedics bag and field medic kit, CH 8 and 101% speech required. Low int characters can only drool, and if you keep it up, it will cause Jack to melt (literally). You earn 200 XP for this.{{< /note >}}

{{< note >}}If you are playing with the NPC Armor Mod installed, you can obtain a metal armor for Marcus here. Talk to Trader Bill and ask him if he's found anything special, and he will offer to sell you the armor for $3000. Marcus has to be in your party though. You have to tell him to wear it while he has it in his inventory (via dialog, not the "wear best armor" button). With Marcus fully leveled and wearing the armor, his defense will be better than a combat armor, but not quite as good as a power armor.{{< /note >}}
