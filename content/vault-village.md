# Vault Village

## 1. Get weapons for Connar to be used at the nearby village

Connar asks you to help the village out by buying some guns for them to defend themselves, and gives you $5,000 upfront for it. He will tell you to find Joe near Cassidy's bar for help in obtaining the guns. Joe sends you to Happy Harry to buy them, and then you can return with the weapons for 800 XP. If your speech skill is bad you will have to pay full price for the weapons ($10,000), but at 50% you should have a good chance to break even. With 80% speech you should be able to get the guns for only $2000 (You have more than one chance to get the result you want, so keep trying until you're satisfied).

After you have given the guns to Connar, Stark and his men will fail with their raid against Vault Village. You can then rat out Happy Harry to Stark (for selling guns) and he'll be sent to the detention center in the courtyard. As a reward you get to help yourself to whatever is in Harry's store.

Talking to Joe can also reveal a better way to solve the problem. Joe will refer you to Councilman McClure, and also tell you some ghouls might be behind the problem. If you ask Connar about the rats he will tell you the same thing, and also give you one of the amulets if you want. Talk to McClure and tell him you think you can get rid of the mole rats by finding out who controls them. When you promise that, he will postpone Vault City's raid on the village with an extra month (so you've got a month + whatever time left of what Stark gave you).

In the Gecko junkyard, find the hole in the back to the hidden home of the 'Brain' rat. The rat will tell you about repairing or optimizing the power plant, depending on what you have done there so far (If you've already done both you don't need to do any favors first). Help him out and you can get him to stop the mole rat attacks (500 XP).

When you return to McClure in Vault City to report that you've stopped the mole rat attacks, he'll agree to leave Vault Village alone. You will also complete the "Resolve the problem with the nearby village" quest for Vault City at the same time (1000 XP + 15 karma).

Return back to Connar for his eternal gratitude, 25 karma and also 1200 XP.

{{< note >}}If you have previously met Councilman McClure when you first talk to Connar, you will have the option to suggest making a deal with McClure. This way has the same solution as the one just above, except you don't get any money. You don't get more XP either, so not a very good idea.{{< /note >}}

{{< note >}}If you take the money from Connar but later decide to go with the McClure way instead you get to keep half the money. (Or all of it if you rather want to, but why would you want that?){{< /note >}}

{{< note >}}If you already happen to have the guns with you the first time you talk to Connar, you can give them to him straight away and get paid $5000 plus the same XP reward as otherwise. You can also try to squeeze out another $1000 from him (small speech roll).{{< /note >}}

{{< note >}}When talking to old Joe, you can get a 10mm pistol by initially pretending you know him.{{< /note >}}

## 2. Put the Village on a trade route

Note that you only get this quest if you solved the first village quest by negotiating with McClure. Also you need to let at least one month pass from the completion of the first quest before you can get this one.

Connar's wife Ann tells you the village needs to be part of a trade route to support them. She wants you to convince trader Robert Baron to make this happen. There's a few ways to accomplish this. You can talk him into it (easy speech roll), pay him $500 (easy barter roll, $1000 if you fail), or use good old intimidation (strength 7, he turns hostile if you have less). If you are married you can offer Miria to sleep with him instead or if you play as a female character you can do it yourself (charisma 7). Back at the village you get 800 XP ($100 + 400 XP if you ask to get paid) if you talk to Ann again.
