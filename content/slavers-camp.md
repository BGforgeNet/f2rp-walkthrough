# Slaver's Camp

This is Metzger's slave camp, where newly arrived slaves are usually kept. Sulik's sister Kurisu is one of them. You can get the direction to this location from Metzger or any of his slaves in the Den if you have freed them, but only if you have Sulik's quest to find his sister active (see the [Umbra Tribe](/umbra-tribe/) section).

You can rescue Sulik's sister, Kurisu, in a peaceful way or just by killing everyone. To do it peacefully you can talk to the leader of the camp, Don, and convince him you're sent by Metzger to get his keys (2 speech rolls, 75% speech will give you a 50% chance to make it). They go to a cell in the small shack to the north-east where Kurisu is being held. The shack is guarded by one man who will question you if he sees you (speech 51%, don't say the usual guy has the flu!), but you can just wait until he has walked around the back.

You can also sneak straight into the shack without talking to anyone, but then you need 90% lockpick for a 50% chance of opening the cell.

When you rescue Kurisu you get to choose if you want to sneak away with her to the Umbra Tribe or if you want to rescue all the slaves first, which means you have to kill all the slavers. To unlock the bigger slave pen use the keys from Don (if you didn't get them earlier you can pick them up from his dead body) or you can pick the lock yourself but it's rather hard. When you are ready to leave you will be taken to the Umbra Tribe automatically. Reuniting Sulik and Kurisu earns you 500 XP and 1000 XP for rescuing her.

{{< note >}}Note that if you didn't kill the slavers they will be hostile the next time you show up at that location.{{< /note >}}
